## 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of async comprehensions and generators in Python. The scripts cover various aspects of asynchronous programming, including creating async generators, using async comprehensions, and measuring the runtime of concurrent coroutines. These exercises are designed to improve understanding of advanced asynchronous operations and their implementation in Python.

| File Name | Description     |
| ------------ | ------------    |
| `0-async_generator.py` | Coroutine that yields random numbers asynchronously |
| `1-async_comprehension.py` | Coroutine that collects 10 random numbers using async comprehension |
| `2-measure_runtime.py` | Function that measures the runtime of concurrent coroutines |

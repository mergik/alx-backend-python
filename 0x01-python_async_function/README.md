## 0x01. Python - Async
This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of asynchronous programming in Python using the `async` and `await` syntax. The scripts cover various aspects of asynchronous programming, including creating and running coroutines, measuring execution time, and working with tasks. These exercises are designed to improve understanding of asynchronous operations and their implementation in Python.
